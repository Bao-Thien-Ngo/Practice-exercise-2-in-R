<h2><strong>Dataset</strong></h2>
<p align="justify"> 
  This dataset “speed.data.csv” contains vehicular speed data before and after a speed limit law was repealed.
</p>

<h2><strong>Questions</strong></h2>
    By using this dataset, I try to quantify the impact of repealing the national maximum speed limit on average speeds on U.S. roads and answer the following questions:


1. Generate boxplots for vehicular before and after speeds data and compare the results.
2. Generate 95% confidence intervals for the variance of before-speed data. Explain each step andinterpret the results.
3. Generate 90% confidence intervals for mean vehicular after-speed data, assuming the population variance is unknown. Explain each step and interpret the results.
4. Test whether the mean speed is greater than 65 mph after repealing the speed limit at the α=1% significance level. Explain each step and interpret the results. 
5. Test whether the variance of after-speed data is less than 20 mph2 at the α=5% significance level. Explain each step and interpret the results. 
6. **Test that the vehicular speed variances before and after are equal at the α=10% significance level. Explain each step and interpret the results. 
7. **Test that the vehicular after-speed mean is greater than before-speed at the α=1% significance level. Explain each step and interpret the results.
8. Use a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test to assess whether the distributions of speeds before and after are equal. Also, draw density plots using before and after speed data. Interpret the results based on both the test and drawing. 

**Consider two samples as independent samples.

These questions are from my teacher's lecture in my class.
